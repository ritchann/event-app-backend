42,"October 29 in Podrum Pristanište, at 16:00, the action ""Return of Names"" will begin in Montenegro.

On the eve of the Day of Remembrance of Victims of Political Repressions, the “Return of Names” campaign is held throughout Russia and abroad every year.

The whole day, replacing each other, people read the names of the repressed - first name, patronymic, last name, age, profession, sentence.

The action was conceived in the Memorial Society, which recently received the Nobel Peace Prize, but from the very beginning and to this day, it has been held by volunteers in many cities.

2022 is the year of a new catastrophe and new victims. However, we are sure that ""The Return of Names"" has a meaning even today.

After all, this action reminds of the most important, unconditional principle: there is nothing more valuable than human life, which means that the state has no right to kill people. Neither in 1937 nor in 2022. And the more people agree with this, the more likely it is that the catastrophe will be stopped and prevented in the future.

In this regard, we invite you on October 29 to Podrum Pristanište, where at 16:00 the “Return of Names” action in Montenegro will begin.

Event: https://fb.me/e/2ZHgjNS7K

We will read out the names of people who were repressed in the Soviet Union, but who had something to do with Yugoslavia. At the same time, according to tradition, each participant in the action, in addition to the name given to him / her, can also read out the names of their relatives and friends who suffered during the terror.",,,,False,"October 29 in Podrum Pristanište, at 16:00, the action ""Return of Names"" will begin in Montenegro.",11/13/2022,16:00

This film is about people who flee from military Russia and fight for a new future - without a tyrant, wars and fear of being put behind bars because you don't want to go to kill for a bloody regime. With the start of the war, many Russians cannot stop feeling pain and involvement in Russian aggression.

The heroes of this film - Yulia, Kirill, Ilya, Inna, Alevtina - were also forced to flee, despite the fact that their lives were firmly connected with Russia. Each of them, risking never to return to Russia again, talks about big obstacles and small but bold steps through them - into a new life.

What is needed for this?

I like the idea of ​​constantly learning.
Feel like a student.
Here is this new reality - and you are a student again, learning to live in new realities.

I like studying every day.
I listen to scriptures for an hour a day, catch one thought from a complex text to think / practice today and voila - the happiness of learning for the whole day!

An early rise is a beautiful dawn, the morning energy of the day fills and puts everything in its place. Morning rituals are much more fun with audio recordings of scriptures. And politics has generally gone below the weather forecast) Why watch the weather forecast when you can just look out the window and see the sea, mountains and the sun!

We first found ourselves in this paradise 16 years ago. And they couldn't get away. They cut themselves off and came back again.

But what can you do in paradise? Just walk with a flute and sing) And in order not to get bored, we made the Game and Practice Center ""Happiness Inside"" in Ulcinj, where we invite guests to taste - how it is to live in paradise)

Some stay, some leave, only to come back later.)

Why are people so drawn to hell? Just force of habit and uncertainty, lack of strength to change something.

There is a habit out of habit)
And for me, these are retreats with my own way of life and sowing new habits)

The nearest retreat is a gaming one. Immersion in the spirit of the Game. Spirit of the Game. Beautiful, is not it?

Immerse yourself in the Spirit of the Game and emerge as a different person 🙂

The retreat will take place for a donation. For everyone.

Yes, and if you have children, you can also participate, as it will be held in parallel with the Robinsonade Family Game Program

We start October 15 - October 22.

Russian stand-up comedian Denis Alien is a comedy with a deep social meaning. The comedian, who is not shown on Russian television, is gaining millions of views on YouTube and gathering thousands of halls. In his monologues there are not only tragicomic observations of an ordinary person, but also a considerable share of politics.

In 2022, when war came to the peaceful life of Europe, Denis Alien is one of the few popular Russians who was not afraid to openly criticize the actions of the authorities. Because of this, after some time he was forced to leave his native country - and now his creative path begins anew.
